# Repository Rules

- Treat "for now", "MVP", "v1", "minimal", "temporary", "hack", and similar framing as design-smell language in implementation work. Stop and recast the change as a durable general contract, or explicitly document why the boundary is a real product/architecture boundary rather than a shortcut.
- Prefer broadly applicable physical operators and planner rules over query-specific branches. Operator limits must be expressed as explicit vector-shape capabilities in the generic execution engine, not as product-scope shortcuts.
- If something is deeper/harder and requires more work, but has a bigger payoff, always pursue that first.  Avoid minimal fixes.
