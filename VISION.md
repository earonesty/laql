# Product spec: `lakeql`

A lightweight TypeScript query engine for Iceberg + Parquet on object storage.

Runs in Cloudflare Workers, browsers, Node, Deno, Bun, and service workers.

Built on:

```txt
hyparquet         (Parquet reads)
hyparquet-writer  (Parquet writes)
h3-js             (H3 cell creation, parents, and grid-disk predicates)
```

Dependency roles:

```txt
hyparquet          pure JS Parquet reads; snappy built in; zstd/gzip/lz4 via
                   hyparquet-compressors; HTTP range reads; column projection;
                   row-group selection

hyparquet-writer   snappy by default, custom compressors pluggable (zstd = bring your own);
                   column statistics on by default; nested records; row-group sizing

h3-js              H3 lat/lon-to-cell, parent, and grid-disk operations used by
                   the expression evaluator
```

Current Iceberg manifest hydration reads lakeql's JSON fixture/manifest format
and uncompressed Avro Iceberg manifest lists/manifests.

Primary use case:

```txt
Query Iceberg/Parquet lakes from object storage without running DuckDB-WASM, Spark, Trino, ClickHouse, or a server.
```

Core promise:

```txt
DuckDB-like usefulness for object-store analytics.
Much smaller surface area.
Native Worker ergonomics.
Streaming results.
Resumable queries via serializable bookmarks.
Predicate pushdown.
Partition-aware reads and writes.
H3 and geospatial functions included.
No native bindings.
No virtual filesystem setup.
No WASM boot tax unless the user explicitly opts into one.
```

# Positioning

`lakeql` is not a database.

It is a query engine for lake files.

It gives users:

```txt
scan
filter
project
aggregate
group
sort
limit
write
compact
partition
inspect
```

It intentionally avoids pretending to be full SQL infrastructure.

It should feel easier than DuckDB-WASM for people who currently want:

```txt
read Parquet from R2/S3/HTTP
query Iceberg tables
filter by partitions
compute H3 cells
run simple geospatial filters
stream JSON/NDJSON results
write partitioned Parquet files
append to Iceberg tables
build APIs over lake data inside Workers
```

---

# Runtime model

`lakeql-core` is runtime-agnostic.

It targets any short-lived, memory-constrained invocation: Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda, edge runtimes, browsers, Node, Deno, Bun, service workers.

Core never imports a runtime API. Everything environmental is a caller-supplied interface:

```txt
object storage       ObjectStore
caching              cache adapters
spill / checkpoints  spill adapter
commit coordination  committer
queueing             none — the engine never talks to a queue;
                     the caller moves bookmarks however it likes
                     (Cloudflare Queues, SQS, DO alarms, cron, a while loop)
state                bookmarks are plain serializable values;
                     where they live is the caller's choice
```

Runtime drivers wire these up:

```txt
lakeql/cloudflare    R2, Cache API, DO committer, Queues recipes
lakeql/lambda        S3, SQS recipes              (same core)
lakeql/node          filesystem / S3              (same core)
```

Cloudflare is the flagship driver, not a dependency.

---

# Responsibility boundary

`lakeql` owns lake-query mechanics:

```txt
read Iceberg and Parquet metadata
plan bounded tasks from snapshots, manifests, files, and row groups
apply predicates and column projection
stream rows and batches within memory budgets
write Parquet output files
generate bookmarks and checkpoints
enforce scan, runtime, memory, output, and concurrency limits
move tasks through retry-safe state transitions
aggregate task and output manifests
execute Iceberg commit protocol mechanics
```

The application owns intent, policy, and infrastructure:

```txt
source selection          catalog/table location, credentials or signed access,
                          snapshot/release choice, source-level filters

query intent              selected fields, predicates, derived columns,
                          row transforms, output schema, partitioning strategy

limits                    max files, row groups, range requests, bytes read,
                          rows per output file, task runtime, memory,
                          concurrency, stale timeout, retry limit

execution substrate       object store, queue, checkpoint/state store,
                          lock or commit coordinator, clock, id generator,
                          logging hooks

output policy             destination prefix, output format, partition layout,
                          manifest format, append/overwrite behavior,
                          promotion rules

lifecycle policy          job id, idempotency key, cancellation behavior,
                          stale detection, retry/requeue behavior,
                          completion and fan-in behavior

observability             progress callbacks, metrics, structured logs,
                          error reporting, audit/event hooks
```

The boundary is intentional: the library turns declared intent and limits into
deterministic bounded work; the application decides what work is meaningful and
where it runs.

import { r2Store } from "lakeql-r2";
import { icebergCatalog } from "lakeql-iceberg";
```

Convenience import:

```ts
import { createLake } from "lakeql/cloudflare";
```

---

# Basic Worker usage

```ts
import { createLake, eq, and, h3Within, bbox, stIntersects } from "lakeql/cloudflare";

export default {
  async fetch(req: Request, env: Env): Promise<Response> {
    const lake = createLake({
      store: env.DATA_BUCKET,
      catalog: {
        type: "iceberg-rest",
        url: env.ICEBERG_REST_URL,
        token: env.ICEBERG_REST_TOKEN,
      },
    });

    const rows = lake
      .table("places")
      .select([
        "id",
        "name",
        "lat",
        "lon",
        "h3_8",
      ])
      .where(and(
        eq("country", "US"),
        eq("state", "CA"),
        h3Within("h3_8", "8829a1d757fffff", 2),
        stIntersects("geom", bbox(-118.35, 33.95, -118.15, 34.15)),
      ))
      .limit(100)
      .streamJson();

    return new Response(rows, {
      headers: {
        "content-type": "application/json",
      },
    });
  },
};
```

NDJSON streaming:

```ts
return new Response(
  lake.table("permits")
    .where(gt("amount", 100_000))
    .limit(10_000)
    .streamNdjson(),
  {
    headers: {
      "content-type": "application/x-ndjson",
    },
  },
);
```

# Public query styles

`lakeql` supports three equivalent query styles.

## 1. Fluent TypeScript API

```ts
const result = await lake.table("sales")
  .select([
    "store_id",
    "date",
    "amount",
  ])
  .where(and(
    eq("region", "west"),
    between("date", "2026-01-01", "2026-06-01"),
    gt("amount", 100),
  ))
  .orderBy("amount", "desc")
  .limit(500)
  .toArray();
```

## 2. JSON query API

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "from": "sales",
  "select": ["store_id", "date", "amount"],
  "where": {
    "and": [
      { "eq": ["region", "west"] },
      { "between": ["date", "2026-01-01", "2026-06-01"] },
      { "gt": ["amount", 100] }
    ]
  },
  "order_by": [{ "column": "amount", "direction": "desc" }],
  "limit": 500
}
```

The format carries an explicit version field so the stable API can evolve.

Worker route:

```ts
const query = await req.json();

const result = lake.query(query).streamNdjson();

return new Response(result, {
  headers: {
    "content-type": "application/x-ndjson",
  },
});
```

## 3. Small SQL dialect

```sql
from sales
select store_id, date, amount
where region = 'west'
  and date between '2026-01-01' and '2026-06-01'
  and amount > 100
order by amount desc
limit 500
```

Function syntax:

```sql
from places
select id, name, lat, lon
where country = 'US'
  and state = 'CA'
  and h3_within(h3_8, '8829a1d757fffff', 2)
  and st_intersects(geom, st_bbox(-118.35, 33.95, -118.15, 34.15))
limit 100
```

The SQL dialect compiles to the same AST as the fluent and JSON APIs.

---

# Language scope

## Query clauses

```txt
from
select
where
group by
aggregate
having
order by
limit
offset
sample
write to
partition by
```

Clause notes:

```txt
aggregate    fluent/JSON name for aggregate expressions; in SQL, aggregates
             appear in select alongside group by
having       filters aggregate results, e.g. having n > 100
sample       row-fraction sampling, e.g. sample 0.01
```

## Supported operators

```txt
=
!=
<
<=
>
>=
in
not in
between
is null
is not null
and
or
not
like
ilike
```

## Supported scalar functions

```txt
lower(value)
upper(value)
trim(value)
substr(value, start, length)
replace(value, search, replacement)

coalesce(a, b, ...)
nullif(a, b)

cast(value, type)

year(timestamp)
month(timestamp)
day(timestamp)
hour(timestamp)
date_trunc(part, timestamp)

round(number, places)
floor(number)
ceil(number)
abs(number)
least(a, b, ...)
greatest(a, b, ...)
```

## Aggregates

```txt
count()
count(column)
count_distinct(column)
sum(column)
avg(column)
min(column)
max(column)
first(column)
last(column)
any(column)
```

`first` and `last` follow scan order, which the planner makes deterministic per snapshot (see Resumable execution). `any` is explicitly nondeterministic.

## Geospatial functions

Geometry format is GeoJSON by default.

WKB and WKT are optional codecs.

```txt
st_point(lon, lat)
st_bbox(minx, miny, maxx, maxy)
st_x(point)
st_y(point)

st_intersects(a, b)
st_contains(a, b)
st_within(a, b)
st_disjoint(a, b)

st_distance(a, b)
st_area(a)
st_length(a)

st_centroid(geom)
st_envelope(geom)

st_as_geojson(geom)
st_from_geojson(value)
st_from_wkt(value)
st_as_wkt(value)
```

## H3 functions

```txt
h3_cell(lat, lon, res)
h3_parent(cell, res)
h3_within(column, origin, k)
h3_in(column, cells)
```

Special pushdown-aware predicates:

```txt
h3_within(h3_8, '8829a1d757fffff', 2)
h3_in(h3_8, [...])
```

These compile into partition pruning when the H3 column is part of the table partition spec.

---

# Type system

Internal types:

```txt
boolean
int32
int64
float32
float64
decimal
string
binary
date
time
timestamp
json
struct
list
map
geometry
h3
```

JS value mapping:

```txt
int64      bigint in rows; JSON/NDJSON emits a number when within
           Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, otherwise a string
decimal    string in rows and in output
timestamp  Date in rows; ISO-8601 string in output
binary     Uint8Array in rows; base64 string in output
```

Type inference comes from:

```txt
Iceberg schema
Parquet schema
explicit JSON query schema
manual table registration
```

Expression analysis validates:

```txt
unknown columns
invalid function names
invalid argument counts
invalid type combinations
unsafe casts
unsupported pushdowns
ambiguous aliases
```

Example error:

```txt
LAKEQL_TYPE_ERROR

st_intersects(left, right) expects geometry-compatible values.

left:
  column: "price"
  type: int64

right:
  st_bbox(...)
  type: geometry

query:
  where st_intersects(price, st_bbox(-118, 33, -117, 34))
```

---

# Execution model

The engine is streaming-first.

Every query can produce:

```ts
AsyncIterable<Row>
ReadableStream<Uint8Array>
Promise<Row[]>
Promise<ArrowLikeBatch[]>
Promise<QueryStats>
Promise<SliceResult>
```

APIs:

```ts
query.rows()
query.batches()
query.toArray()
query.first()
query.count()
query.streamJson()
query.streamNdjson()
query.streamCsv()
query.writeParquet(...)
query.explain()
query.stats()
query.run({ slice })
query.resumableBatches({ bookmarkEvery })
lake.resume(bookmark)
```

Example:

```ts
for await (const row of lake.table("events").where(eq("type", "click")).rows()) {
  console.log(row);
}
```

Batch streaming:

```ts
for await (const batch of lake.table("events").select(["user_id", "ts"]).batches({ size: 4096 })) {
  await processBatch(batch);
}
```

---

# Resumable execution

Every query position is addressable.

Lake files are immutable and reads are pinned to a snapshot, so an in-flight query can be serialized, shipped anywhere, and resumed.

The primitive is the bookmark.

```ts
type Bookmark = {
  version: 1;
  planFingerprint: string;
  snapshot: string;
  position: {
    fileIndex: number;
    rowGroup: number;
    rowOffset: number;
  };
  operatorState?: {
    limitEmitted?: number;
    groupBy?: SerializedHashTable | { spillRef: string };
    topK?: SerializedHeap;
    sketches?: Record<string, Uint8Array>;
  };
};

type SliceResult = {
  rows: Row[];
  bookmark?: Bookmark;
};
```

## Determinism

The planner orders data files deterministically for a given query and snapshot.

```txt
planFingerprint = hash(normalized AST, snapshot id, schema id, engine version)
```

Resume re-plans and validates the fingerprint.

Mismatch fails loudly:

```txt
LAKEQL_BOOKMARK_STALE
```

Task manifests are deterministic too: the same normalized query, snapshot,
schema, partition spec, and write options produce the same ordered task list.
Each task has a stable id derived from its input files, row-group ranges,
partition values, and output role.

Write output manifests are deterministic records of produced files:

```txt
task id
output path
partition values
row count
byte size
content hash / etag
Iceberg data file metadata
```

## Slice API

```ts
const { rows, bookmark } = await lake.table("events")
  .where(eq("type", "click"))
  .run({
    slice: {
      maxMs: 20_000,
      maxFiles: 50,
    },
  });
```

`bookmark` is absent when the query completed.

Resume:

```ts
const next = await lake.resume(bookmark).run({
  slice: { maxMs: 20_000 },
});
```

## Periodic bookmarks while streaming

Long-running clients checkpoint from time to time:

```ts
for await (const { batch, bookmark } of query.resumableBatches({ bookmarkEvery: "30s" })) {
  await processBatch(batch);
  await saveCheckpoint(bookmark);
}
```

Crash, restart, resume from the last saved bookmark.

## Operator classes

```txt
position-only
  scan, filter, project, limit, offset
  bookmark is a file/row-group/row position plus counters

serialized state
  group by, top-k sort, approximate sketches
  operator state serializes into or alongside the bookmark

spill-backed
  global sort, hash join
  spill files are the checkpoint
  the bookmark holds references
```

The spill adapter and the checkpoint store are the same abstraction.

Large operator state is externalized so bookmarks stay small enough for a queue message, a KV value, or a URL:

```txt
_lakeql/tmp/query-<id>/state/
```

## Worker slicing

Each slice fits one invocation. The bookmark rides the queue.

```ts
export default {
  async queue(batch: MessageBatch<{ bookmark: Bookmark }>, env: Env) {
    for (const msg of batch.messages) {
      const { rows, bookmark } = await lake.resume(msg.body.bookmark).run({
        slice: { maxMs: 20_000 },
      });

      await appendToSink(env, rows);

      if (bookmark) {
        await env.LAKE_JOBS.send({ bookmark });
      }
    }
  },
};
```

The same loop works from a Durable Object alarm, a Lambda + SQS consumer, or any scheduler that can hold a small JSON value. The engine only produces and consumes bookmarks; the transport is the caller's.

Queue retries are safe by construction. A retried message replays the same
bookmark against the same deterministic task id and output manifest. Already
completed task outputs are recognized by manifest entry and content identity,
so retries either reuse the committed output or replace an incomplete temporary
object before advancing the bookmark.

Queue-visible side effects happen at task boundaries:

```txt
write temporary output
verify output manifest entry
promote output or include it in the final Iceberg commit
emit next bookmark
ack message
```

## Cursor pagination

In HTTP server mode the bookmark doubles as a pagination token.

```json
{
  "rows": [...],
  "nextToken": "..."
}
```

Next page:

```json
{
  "resume": "<nextToken>"
}
```

The bookmark pins a snapshot, so pagination is consistent even while the table changes.

Tokens that cross a trust boundary are HMAC-signed or stored server-side by id.

Forged or corrupted positions fail loudly:

```txt
LAKEQL_BOOKMARK_INVALID
```

## Resumable writes

Write jobs bookmark the same way.

```txt
data files fully written so far
in-flight multipart upload state (uploadId, completed part etags)
partition writer positions
```

The Iceberg commit is the atomic finalize.

A long CTAS or compaction is a chain of slices ending in one commit.

# Query planner

Planner stages:

```txt
parse
normalize
analyze
bind schema
constant fold
split predicates
classify pushdowns
plan Iceberg snapshot
plan manifests
plan data files
plan Parquet row groups
plan projected columns
plan residual evaluation
plan aggregation
plan output format
```

Predicate classes:

```ts
type PredicatePlan = {
  partition?: Expr;
  manifest?: Expr;
  fileStats?: Expr;
  rowGroupStats?: Expr;
  residual?: Expr;
};
```

Example query:

```sql
from permits
select id, address, amount
where state = 'CA'
  and county = 'ventura'
  and issued_date between '2026-01-01' and '2026-06-01'
  and amount > 100000
  and st_intersects(geom, st_bbox(-119.6, 33.9, -118.5, 34.5))
limit 100
```

Planner output:

```txt
partition predicates
  state = 'CA'
  county = 'ventura'
  issued_date_day >= '2026-01-01'
  issued_date_day <= '2026-06-01'

file stats predicates
  amount > 100000

row group predicates
  amount > 100000

column projection
  id
  address
  amount
  geom

residual predicates
  issued_date between '2026-01-01' and '2026-06-01'
  st_intersects(geom, bbox)

limit
  100
```

# Explain output

Human format:

```ts
const plan = await lake.sql(`

  select id, name
  where state = 'CA'
    and h3_within(h3_8, '8829a1d757fffff', 2)
  limit 100
`).explain();

console.log(plan.text);
```

Output:

# Object store abstraction

Interface:

```ts
export interface ObjectStore {
  get(path: string): Promise<Uint8Array | null>;

  getRange(path: string, range: {
    offset: number;
    length: number;
  }): Promise<Uint8Array>;

  put(path: string, body: Uint8Array | ReadableStream<Uint8Array>, options?: PutOptions): Promise<void>;

  delete(path: string): Promise<void>;

  list(prefix: string, options?: ListOptions): AsyncIterable<ObjectInfo>;

  head(path: string): Promise<ObjectHead | null>;
}
```

R2 adapter:

```ts
const store = r2Store(env.BUCKET);
```

HTTP adapter:

```ts
const store = httpStore({
  baseUrl: "https://example.com/data/",
  headers: {
    authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
  },
});
```

S3 adapter:

```ts
const store = s3Store({
  endpoint: "https://...",
  bucket: "lake",
  region: "auto",
  accessKeyId,
  secretAccessKey,
});
```

---

# Iceberg support

Supported table sources:

```txt
Iceberg REST catalog
R2 object layout catalog
S3 object layout catalog
static metadata.json URL
local metadata file in Node
```

Supported reads:

```txt
latest snapshot
snapshot by id
snapshot by timestamp
branch
tag
schema evolution
partition evolution
manifest lists
position delete files
equality delete files
```

Delete handling modes:

```txt
strict                       (default) snapshots containing delete file types
                             the engine cannot apply fail loudly instead of
                             silently returning deleted rows

ignore-deletes               skip all delete files; raw scan

ignore-unsupported-deletes   apply supported delete files, skip the rest
```

```ts
lake.table("events", { readMode: "ignore-unsupported-deletes" })
```

Strict failure:

```txt
LAKEQL_UNSUPPORTED_DELETE_FILES

Snapshot 482719204991 contains equality delete files.
This engine build applies position deletes only.

Set readMode: "ignore-unsupported-deletes" to scan anyway.
```

Delete handling covers the Iceberg delete mechanisms that affect row visibility:

```txt
position delete files
v3 deletion vectors
equality delete files
```

Strict mode fails loudly on delete formats from newer Iceberg spec versions than the engine knows.

The opt-outs remain as escape hatches for intentional raw scans.

Supported writes:

```txt
append data files
overwrite partitions
create table
replace table
schema evolution
partition evolution
snapshot metadata writes
commit retry through catalog
single-writer commit coordinator
```

Cloudflare Worker commit coordinator:

```ts
export class LakeCommitCoordinator extends DurableObject {
  async append(table: string, files: DataFile[]): Promise<CommitResult> {
    return this.lake.commitAppend(table, files);
  }
}
```

Public Worker helper:

```ts
const lake = createLake({
  store: env.DATA_BUCKET,
  catalog: icebergRestCatalog(...),
  commits: durableObjectCommitter(env.LAKE_COMMITS),
});
```

Append:

```ts
await lake.table("events").insert(rows, {
  partitionBy: ["date", "h3_7"],
});
```

Overwrite partition:

```ts
await lake.table("events").overwritePartitions(rows, {
  partitionBy: ["date", "h3_7"],
});
```

Create table:

```ts
await lake.createTable("events", {
  schema: {
    id: "string",
    ts: "timestamp",
    lat: "float64",
    lon: "float64",
    h3_7: "string",
    date: "date",
    payload: "json",
  },
  partitionBy: [
    "date",
    "h3_7",
  ],
});
```

# Parquet support

Reads:

```txt
HTTP/R2/S3 range reads
footer reads
schema reads
column projection
row group pruning
row-group streaming
row-group-sized batches
dictionary filtering where available

  rowGroupSize: 50_000,
});
```

Partitioned write API:

  partitionBy: [
    "date",
    "h3_7",
  ],
  maxRowsPerFile: 100_000,

```

# Write semantics

`lakeql` distinguishes three write modes.

## 1. Plain partitioned Parquet

```ts
await lake.files("events/")
  .insert(rows)
  .partitionBy(["date", "h3_7"])
  .write();
```

No Iceberg metadata.

Useful for simple lake directories.

## 2. Iceberg append

```ts
await lake.table("events")
  .insert(rows)
  .partitionBy(["date", "h3_7"])
  .commit();
```

Writes Parquet files and commits Iceberg metadata.

## 3. CTAS

```ts
await lake.createTableAs("ca_places",
  lake.table("places")
    .where(eq("state", "CA"))
    .select(["id", "name", "lat", "lon", "h3_8"]),
  {
    partitionBy: ["h3_8"],
  },
);
```

SQL equivalent:

```sql
create table ca_places
partition by h3_8
as
from places
select id, name, lat, lon, h3_8
where state = 'CA'
```

---

# Geospatial design

Geometry columns are represented internally as:

```ts
type GeometryValue =
  | GeoJSON.Geometry
  | Wkb
  | Wkt
  | BBox;
```

Tables can declare geometry metadata:

```ts
await lake.registerTable("places", {
  path: "places/",
  format: "parquet",
  schema,
  geometry: {
    column: "geom",
    encoding: "geojson",
    srid: 4326,
    bboxColumns: {
      minx: "minx",
      miny: "miny",
      maxx: "maxx",
      maxy: "maxy",
    },
  },
});
```

When bbox columns exist, `st_intersects` gets pushdown.

Query:

```sql
from parcels
select parcel_id, owner
where st_intersects(geom, st_bbox(-118.9, 34.1, -118.6, 34.3))
```

Planner rewrite:

```txt
file/row-group pushdown
  maxx >= -118.9
  minx <= -118.6
  maxy >= 34.1
  miny <= 34.3

residual
  st_intersects(geom, bbox)
```

---

# H3 design

H3 columns are treated as typed strings with metadata.

Register:

```ts
await lake.registerTable("places", {
  path: "places/",
  format: "iceberg",
  h3: {
    columns: {
      h3_7: { resolution: 7 },
      h3_8: { resolution: 8 },
    },
  },
});
```

Generated columns:

```ts
await lake.table("places").insert(rows, {
  generated: {
    h3_7: h3Cell("lat", "lon", 7),
    h3_8: h3Cell("lat", "lon", 8),
  },
  partitionBy: ["h3_7"],
});
```

SQL:

```sql
from places
select id, name
where h3_within(h3_8, h3_cell(34.0522, -118.2437, 8), 2)
```

Planner rewrite:

```txt
h3_within(h3_8, origin, 2)
  -> h3_8 in [cell1, cell2, ...]
```

If table is partitioned by `h3_8`, this becomes partition pruning.

If table is partitioned by `h3_7`, planner can rewrite using parents:

```txt
h3_8 in cells
  -> h3_7 in distinct parents
```

Residual filter remains exact.

---

# Index sidecars

Finished product includes optional sidecar indexes.

These are not required for correctness.

Supported sidecars:

```txt
_lakeql/index/bbox
_lakeql/index/h3
_lakeql/index/bloom
_lakeql/index/minmax
_lakeql/index/textgram
```

Index metadata:

```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "table": "places",
  "snapshot": "482719204991",
  "indexes": [
    {
      "type": "h3",
      "column": "h3_8",
      "path": "_lakeql/index/h3/h3_8/",
      "granularity": "file"
    },
    {
      "type": "bbox",
      "columns": ["minx", "miny", "maxx", "maxy"],
      "path": "_lakeql/index/bbox/geom/",
      "granularity": "row_group"
    }
  ]
}
```

Usage:

```ts
await lake.table("places").createIndex("h3_8", {
  type: "h3",
});

await lake.table("parcels").createIndex("geom", {
  type: "bbox",
});
```

Planner automatically uses sidecars when present.

---

# Caching

Built-in cache layers:

```txt
schema cache
Iceberg metadata cache
manifest cache
Parquet footer cache
row group stats cache
small object cache
H3 expansion cache
parsed query cache
compiled expression cache
```

Cloudflare-compatible cache adapters:

```ts
memoryCache()
cacheApiCache(caches.default)
kvCache(env.LAKE_CACHE)
durableObjectCache(env.LAKE_CACHE_DO)
```

Config:

```ts
const lake = createLake({
  store,
  catalog,
  cache: {
    metadata: cacheApiCache(caches.default),
    footers: cacheApiCache(caches.default),
    expressions: memoryCache(),
  },
});
```

Cache keys include:

```txt
object path
etag
snapshot id
query hash
schema id
partition spec id
```

---

# Security model

The JSON query API is safe by construction.

No arbitrary JS execution.

No query-supplied functions. Extensions are registered by the developer at configuration time, never from query input.

No `eval`.

No filesystem access.

No network access except configured object stores/catalogs.

Policy layer:

```ts
const lake = createLake({
  store,
  catalog,
  policy: {
    tables: {
      places: {
        allowColumns: ["id", "name", "lat", "lon", "category"],
        denyColumns: ["email", "phone"],
        maxLimit: 1000,
        requireWhere: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Row-level policy:

```ts
policy: {
  tables: {
    permits: {
      rowFilter: ctx => eq("tenant_id", ctx.tenantId),
    },
  },
}
```

Context is supplied per request:

```ts
const rows = await lake.withContext({ tenantId })
  .table("permits")
  .limit(100)
  .toArray();
```

Query budget:

```ts
budget: {
  maxFiles: 500,
  maxBytes: 512 * 1024 * 1024,
  maxRowsDecoded: 2_000_000,
  maxOutputRows: 10_000,
  timeoutMs: 25_000,
}
```

If exceeded:

```txt
LAKEQL_BUDGET_EXCEEDED

Query would scan 14,822 files.
Budget allows 500 files.

Add a partition filter, date filter, h3 filter, or limit.
```

# DuckDB-WASM replacement features

These are the “people using DuckDB-WASM today will switch” features.

## 1. No WASM boot ceremony

DuckDB-WASM requires bundle selection, worker setup, database instantiation, file registration, and virtual filesystem choices.

`lakeql`:

```ts
const lake = createLake({ store: env.BUCKET });
const rows = await lake.path("events/*.parquet").where(eq("type", "click")).limit(100).toArray();
```

## 2. Object store native

No manual file registration.

No fake local files.

No virtual filesystem.

```ts
lake.path("s3://bucket/events/date=2026-06-10/*.parquet")
lake.path("r2://events/date=2026-06-10/*.parquet")
lake.path("https://example.com/events/*.parquet")
```

## 3. Iceberg native

```ts
lake.table("events").snapshot("latest")
lake.table("events").snapshot(482719204991)
lake.table("events").asOf("2026-06-01T00:00:00Z")
```

## 4. Worker-native streaming

```ts
return new Response(query.streamNdjson());
```

## 5. H3 built in

```sql
where h3_within(h3_8, h3_cell(34.0522, -118.2437, 8), 2)
```

## 6. ST functions built in

```sql
where st_intersects(geom, st_bbox(-118.35, 33.95, -118.15, 34.15))
```

## 7. Direct partitioned writes

```ts
await lake.table("events").insert(rows, {
  partitionBy: ["date", "h3_7"],
});
```

## 8. Query budget built in

```ts
await query.withBudget({
  maxBytes: 100_000_000,
  maxOutputRows: 1000,
}).toArray();
```

## 9. Explain that talks in object-store terms

```txt
files skipped
manifests skipped
row groups skipped
columns loaded
bytes requested
range requests made
```

## 10. API-first JSON queries

DuckDB is SQL-first.

`lakeql` is API-first.

The JSON query format is stable, safe, serializable, cacheable, and easy for LLMs/UI builders to generate.

# Filesystem/path API

Simple Parquet paths:

```ts
const rows = await lake.path("events/date=2026-06-10/*.parquet")

# HTTP server mode

`lakeql` can expose a safe query endpoint.

```ts
import { lakeqlHandler } from "lakeql/cloudflare";

export default {
  fetch: lakeqlHandler({
    store: env.DATA_BUCKET,
    catalog: icebergRestCatalog({
      url: env.ICEBERG_REST_URL,
      token: env.ICEBERG_REST_TOKEN,
    }),
    policy: {
      maxLimit: 5000,
      requireLimit: true,
      denyColumns: ["ssn", "email"],
    },
  }),
};
```

Request:

```http
POST /query
content-type: application/json
```

```json
{
  "from": "places",
  "select": ["id", "name", "lat", "lon"],
  "where": {
    "eq": ["state", "CA"]
  },
  "limit": 100
}
```

Response:

```json
{
  "rows": [
    {
      "id": "p1",
      "name": "Example",
      "lat": 34.05,
      "lon": -118.24
    }
  ],
  "stats": {
    "filesRead": 3,
    "filesSkipped": 421,
    "bytesRead": 812944,
    "rowsDecoded": 1984,
    "rowsReturned": 100
  }
}
```

Streaming endpoint:

```http
POST /query.ndjson
```

Response:

```txt
{"id":"p1","name":"Example"}
{"id":"p2","name":"Example 2"}
```

---

# Result formats

Supported output formats:

```txt
json
ndjson
csv
parquet
arrow-like batches
async rows
```

JSON:

```ts
await query.toArray();
```

NDJSON:

```ts
query.streamNdjson();
```

CSV:

```ts
query.streamCsv({
  header: true,
});
```

Parquet:

```ts
await query.writeParquet("exports/result.parquet", {
  compression: "zstd",
});
```

---

# Aggregation behavior

Small aggregations run inside the Worker.

```ts
await lake.table("events")
  .where(eq("date", "2026-06-10"))
  .groupBy(["event"])
  .aggregate({
    count: count(),
    users: countDistinct("user_id"),
  })
  .toArray();
```

SQL:

```sql
from events
select event, count() as n, count_distinct(user_id) as users
where date = '2026-06-10'
group by event
having n > 100
order by n desc
```

Memory-safe aggregation requires a budget:

```ts
.groupBy(["event"], {
  maxGroups: 10_000,
})
```

If exceeded:

```txt
LAKEQL_GROUP_LIMIT_EXCEEDED

Aggregation produced more than 10,000 groups.
Use a lower-cardinality group key or increase maxGroups.
```

Approximate aggregates:

```txt
approx_count_distinct
top_k
histogram
quantile
```

Example:

```sql
from events
select approx_count_distinct(user_id) as users
where date = '2026-06-10'
```

---

# Sort behavior

Sorts are explicit about memory.

Allowed without special config:

```txt
order by after limit
order by aggregate result
order by small bounded scan
```

Example:

```sql
from events
select event, count() as n
where date = '2026-06-10'
group by event
order by n desc
limit 20
```

Large unbounded global sort requires a spill adapter.

```ts
const lake = createLake({
  store,
  spill: r2Spill(env.TEMP_BUCKET),
});
```

Then:

```ts
await lake.table("events")
  .orderBy("ts")
  .limit(100_000)
  .toArray();
```

Spill files are temporary and namespaced:

```txt
_lakeql/tmp/query-<id>/
```

---

# Joins

Finished product supports constrained joins, because real DuckDB-WASM users expect them.

Supported joins:

```txt
hash join
semi join
anti join
lookup join
broadcast join
```

Primary Worker-safe join pattern:

```ts
await lake.table("events")
  .join(lake.table("users").where(eq("country", "US")).select(["user_id", "plan"]), {
    on: "user_id",
    type: "inner",
    strategy: "broadcast",
    maxRightRows: 100_000,
  })
  .limit(1000)
  .toArray();
```

SQL:

```sql
from events
join users on events.user_id = users.user_id
select events.ts, users.plan, events.event
where users.country = 'US'
limit 1000
```

The planner rejects unsafe joins unless a spill adapter or explicit budget is configured.

---

# Text search

Basic text operations:

```txt
like
ilike
contains
starts_with
ends_with
regexp_match
```

Optional textgram sidecar index:

```ts
await lake.table("businesses").createIndex("name", {
  type: "textgram",
  minGram: 3,
  maxGram: 5,
});
```

Query:

```sql
from businesses
select id, name
where text_contains(name, 'plumber')
limit 100
```

---

# Schema evolution

Iceberg schema evolution support:

```ts
await lake.table("events").alterSchema(schema => schema
  .addColumn("session_id", "string")
  .renameColumn("user", "user_id")
  .dropColumn("legacy_field")
);
```

Parquet directory schema merge:

```ts
const schema = await lake.path("events/**/*.parquet").mergeSchema();
```

Strict mode:

```ts
await lake.writeParquet(path, rows, {
  schema,
  onSchemaMismatch: "error",
});
```

Permissive mode:

```ts
await lake.writeParquet(path, rows, {
  schema,
  onSchemaMismatch: "coerce-null",
});
```

---

# Data validation

Built-in validation:

```ts
await lake.table("events").insert(rows, {
  validate: {
    required: ["id", "ts", "event"],
    unique: ["id"],
    ranges: {
      lat: [-90, 90],
      lon: [-180, 180],
    },
    enum: {
      event: ["view", "click", "signup", "purchase"],
    },
  },
});
```

Validation failures:

```txt
LAKEQL_VALIDATION_ERROR

Column "lat" must be between -90 and 90.

row:
  18422

value:
  213.991
```

---

# Observability

Every query returns stats.

```ts
const q = lake.table("events")
  .where(eq("date", "2026-06-10"))
  .limit(100);

const rows = await q.toArray();
const stats = await q.stats();
```

A query handle retains the stats from its most recent execution. `stats()` reads them without re-running the query.

Stats:

```ts
type QueryStats = {
  queryId: string;
  elapsedMs: number;

  manifestsRead: number;
  manifestsSkipped: number;

  filesPlanned: number;
  filesRead: number;
  filesSkipped: number;

  rowGroupsRead: number;
  rowGroupsSkipped: number;

  columnsRead: string[];

  bytesRequested: number;
  rangeRequests: number;

  rowsDecoded: number;
  rowsMatched: number;
  rowsReturned: number;

  cacheHits: number;
  cacheMisses: number;
};
```

Logging hook:

```ts
const lake = createLake({
  store,
  catalog,
  log: event => console.log(JSON.stringify(event)),
});
```

Events:

```txt
query.start
query.plan
query.file.read
query.rowgroup.skip
query.cache.hit
query.cache.miss
query.finish
query.error
```

---

# Error model

Errors are structured.

```ts
try {
  await query.toArray();
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof LakeqlError) {
    console.error(e.code);
    console.error(e.message);
    console.error(e.details);
  }
}
```

Codes:

```txt
LAKEQL_PARSE_ERROR
LAKEQL_TYPE_ERROR
LAKEQL_UNKNOWN_TABLE
LAKEQL_UNKNOWN_COLUMN
LAKEQL_UNSUPPORTED_PUSHDOWN
LAKEQL_BUDGET_EXCEEDED
LAKEQL_OBJECT_NOT_FOUND

LAKEQL_UNSUPPORTED_DELETE_FILES
LAKEQL_PARQUET_READ_ERROR
LAKEQL_PARQUET_WRITE_ERROR

```

---

# Extension system

Function extension:

```ts
lake.functions.register("domain", {
  args: ["string"],
  returns: "string",
  deterministic: true,
  pushdown: false,
  eval: value => value.split("@")[1] ?? null,
});
```

Aggregate extension:

```ts
lake.aggregates.register("median_approx", {
  input: "float64",
  state: () => new QuantileSketch(),
  add: (state, value) => state.add(value),
  merge: (a, b) => a.merge(b),
  serialize: state => state.toBytes(),
  deserialize: bytes => QuantileSketch.fromBytes(bytes),
  finish: state => state.quantile(0.5),
});
```

`serialize` and `deserialize` make custom aggregates bookmark-safe.

Codec extension:

```ts
lake.codecs.register("wkb", {
  decode: bytes => decodeWkb(bytes),
  encode: geom => encodeWkb(geom),
});
```

Store extension:

```ts
lake.stores.register("my-store", myObjectStore);
```

```ts
export default {
  async fetch(req: Request, env: Env) {
    const url = new URL(req.url);

    const lat = Number(url.searchParams.get("lat"));
    const lon = Number(url.searchParams.get("lon"));
    const k = Number(url.searchParams.get("k") ?? 2);

    const lake = createLake({
      store: env.DATA_BUCKET,
      catalog: icebergCatalog({
        metadataPath: "warehouse/places/metadata/current.metadata.json",
      }),
    });

    const origin = h3Cell(lat, lon, 8);

    return new Response(
      lake.table("places")
        .select(["id", "name", "category", "lat", "lon"])
        .where(h3Within("h3_8", origin, k))
        .limit(100)
        .streamJson(),
      {
        headers: {
          "content-type": "application/json",
        },
      },
    );
  },
};
```

## Append events

```ts
const rows = await req.json();

await lake.table("events").insert(rows, {
  generated: {
    date: dateTrunc("day", col("ts")),
    h3_7: h3Cell(col("lat"), col("lon"), 7),
  },
  partitionBy: ["date", "h3_7"],
  maxRowsPerFile: 50_000,
});
```

## Export filtered result as Parquet

```ts
await lake.table("permits")
  .where(and(
    eq("county", "ventura"),
    between("issued_date", "2026-01-01", "2026-06-01"),
  ))
  .select(["id", "address", "amount", "issued_date"])
  .writeParquet("exports/ventura-permits-2026.parquet");
```

# Implementation Map

Major subsystems and their responsibilities:

```txt
1. core read path
   AST, expression evaluator, planner skeleton
   lakeql-http + lakeql-parquet (hyparquet adapter)
   scan / filter / project / limit over plain Parquet paths
   row-group streaming, streaming rows, NDJSON

2. pruning
   predicate split and classification
   row-group stats pruning, column projection
   Hive partition discovery and partition pruning

3. Iceberg reads
   in-repo metadata, snapshots, JSON/Avro manifests, manifest pruning
   position deletes, deletion vectors, equality deletes
   strict mode fails loudly on unknown delete formats

4. R2/S3 adapters + Worker ergonomics
   createLake, budgets, stats, explain, policy layer

5. task manifests, bookmarks, retry semantics
   deterministic task manifests
   deterministic output manifests
   slice API and bookmark serialization
   queue-safe retry semantics

6. aggregation, sort, bounded memory operators
   group by, aggregates, top-k sort
   serialized operator state
   spill-backed operator contract

7. writes
   hyparquet-writer adapter, partitioned writes
   deterministic output manifests
   pluggable compression
   Iceberg append commit via object-store or REST catalog commit coordinator
   commit requirements and updates
   resumable writes

8. the rest, additive on the core
   geo + H3, SQL dialect, sidecar indexes, CLI, joins, spill
```

# What the VISION says

````md
# lakeql

lakeql is a lightweight TypeScript query engine for Parquet and Iceberg on object storage.

It runs in Cloudflare Workers, browsers, Node, Deno, Bun, and service workers.

It is designed for API builders who want to query lake data directly from R2, S3, or HTTP without running DuckDB-WASM, Spark, Trino, or a database server.

```ts
const rows = await lake.table("places")
  .select(["id", "name", "lat", "lon"])
  .where(and(
    eq("state", "CA"),
    h3Within("h3_8", "8829a1d757fffff", 2),
  ))
  .limit(100)
  .toArray();
```

lakeql supports:

* Iceberg tables
* Parquet files
* partition pruning
* row-group pruning
* column projection
* streaming results
* H3 functions
* geospatial functions
* partitioned writes
* Iceberg appends
* safe JSON query APIs
* resumable queries with bookmarks
* Worker-native R2 access

# The key design rule

Every feature has to answer one of these questions:

```txt
Can it skip files?
Can it skip row groups?
Can it skip columns?
Can it stream results safely?
Can it write lake-compatible files?
Can it make Worker APIs simpler than DuckDB-WASM?
```

If yes, it belongs.

If no, it belongs outside the core.
