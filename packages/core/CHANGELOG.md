# lakeql-core

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6547014: Spatial predicates (`st_intersects`, `st_contains`, `st_within`, `st_disjoint`)
  now return exact geometry answers via Turf instead of bounding-box
  approximations. Bounding boxes remain a cheap prefilter — and the sidecar bbox
  index still prunes files — but the final predicate is computed on the real
  geometry, so polygons whose envelopes overlap without their shapes touching are
  correctly reported as disjoint. `st_distance` remains envelope-based.

### Patch Changes

- 08c94d5: Advance BUILD_PLAN implementation across resource controls, object-store hardening, Iceberg and Parquet contracts, compatibility docs, examples, and benchmark scaffolding.
